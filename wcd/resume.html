    		<h1>Objectives</h1>
    		<p>I am a Singapore Polytechnic student pursuing Diploma in Information Technology, wishing to work with IT or IT related industry. I love all sorts of programming but I have special prefferences for web and mobile. Last but not least, I would also love to share my experiences and help people in need.</p>

    		<h1>Education</h1>
            <h2>Permai Plus School</h2>
            <p>
                2005 - 2013<br />
    			I studied in Permai Plus School since Primary 3 (year 2005). It is a school in North Jakarta which implements Singapore's system of education. Thus all courses besides Indonesian language are taught using English language. I was one of the students of the first batch. So my class always takes on the senior role. When I was Primary 6 (year 2009), I earned the certificate of the top student to score for PSLE. When I was Secondary 1, our school participated in ICAS (International Competitions and Assessments for School). I took part and won a silver medal for the Science category. It was from my Secondary 2 year onwards that my school started implementing the IGCSE (International General Certificate of Secondary Education) curriculum. It is an International version of the GCE O Level curriculum in Singapore. At the end of my Secondary 4 (year 2013), I graduated with the following grades:<br />
    			6A*s, 2As, 1B<br />
            </p>
            <h2>Jakarta International College (MUFY Programme)</h2>
            <p>
                2013 - 2014<br />
    			A few months after I graduated, I enrolled into the MUFY (Monash University Foundation Year) programme at Jakarta International College. It is a foundation programme for students who would like to study in Australia. Initially my plan was to get into a polytechnic in Singapore but because polytechnics in Singapore start the shool year on April and I graduated from PPS on June 2013, I would have to wait for another 10 months to be enrolled into a polytechnic. My mom did not want that and made me study in the MUFY programme to let me study in my 10 months gap. I sent admission letters to all polytechnics in Singapore except Republic Polytechnic as I missed the deadline. In the end, I got accepted to most of the polytechnics and considering Singapore Polytechnic being my initial genuine choice, I chose SP.<br />

            <h2>Singapore Polytechnic</h2>
            <p>
                2014 - current<br />
    			I am currently studying in Singapore Polytechnic. At first, it took quite some time to adapt to the culture in Singapore. I learned and experienced a lot in SP, and still am. My first semester I scored a GPA of 3.917.
    			<br />
    		</p>
    		<h1>Character</h1>
    		<p>I am a hard worker, learner and a "do-er". I love to do stuff but also at the same time, think about stuffs. I am a cheerful boy but I do work seriously. I love to go outside and explore new stuff. I consider myself as an opportunist. Whenever an opportunity come to me, I would usually take it with consideration. My weekends are usually packed with out-of-school events so I rarely get a chance to stay home all day. I would not lie to myself; I am always tired but I still can hold on and carry on with life. I have a group of wonderful friends in SP and also another group of cool friends in PPS. </p>
    		<h1>Language</h1>
    		<h2>English</h2>
            <p>
    			Despite being a Chinese, I can speak English quite fluently due to the English teaching system of my alma mater. I can write in English just as well.<br />
    		</p>
    		<h2>Mandarin Chinese</h2>
            <p>
    			Born a Chinese, I speak Mandarin within my family. Mandarin is my most fluent language but only lacks some vocabulary.<br />
    		</p>
    		<h2>Bahasa Indonesia</h2>
            <p>
    			Living in Indonesia ever since my birth undoubtedly made me learn the language. However, since my alma mater taught mostly in English, my Bahasa conversational skill faded although, I still can speak some informal Bahasa and understand Bahasa conversations well.<br />
    		</p>
            <h1>Certification</h1>
    		<h2>IGCSE</h2>
            <p>IGCSE is International General Certificate of Secondary Education. It is a certificate for secondary school graduation certified by University of Cambridge. I scored as the top student of the first batch in my secondary school (Permai Plus School).</p>
            <h2>ICAS</h2>
            <p>ICAS stands for International Competitions and Assessments for School. ICAS are independent skill-based assessments wih a competition element (quoted from ICAS site). I took part representing my school in the Mathematics and Science category of the test. I achieved the distinction level for Mathematics and the high distinction level for Science and won a silver medal.</p>
            <h2>Kumon</h2>
            <p>Kumon is a mathematics educational method which teaches student with a clear and deep understanding in further mathematics up to the level of Trigonometry and Calculus. I started taking Kumon tuitions at the start of my secondary 1 school year (around June 2009) with level D and completed the standard levels of Kumon up to level O during my time as well as further taking extra levels (level X) which covers more advanced materials such as matrices, permutations and combinations, and statistics which are up to the tertiary level of study. I completed level X halfway through my secondary 4 year (end of year 2012), earning myself a trophy of completion, another trophy for my speed in study, and a certificate of completion.</p>
