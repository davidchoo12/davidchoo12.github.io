	    		<p>This was my first ever hackathon. A hackathon is an event where a group of people come together and build solutions to solve or otherwise to improve real world problems. This hackathon was my first step into SEED. SEED is a special interest group of students with like minded interest in IT as well as students who want to build not just on academic values but also core values.<br />
          <br />
          It was very tiring as I did not sleep throughout the night. My team consisted of 2 seniors, Boon Keat and Gabriel, and 2 classmates, Azeem and Jess. I was handed a task to extract out a clock made on HTML and Javascript and at that time I had no clue whatsoever on Javascript but I had experience with HTML and Java. Thanks to those skills, I managed to slowly figure things out in the codes and extracted the clock out. After that, I went on to do more stuffs handed down by the seniors. I was thankful to my seniors for giving us, the year 1s, a chance to learn.<br />
          <br />
          What we build was a web app which uses geolocation datas to let bakeries or bread shops to look for nearby volunteers who would deliver unsold breads to the neighbourhoods in need. This app was build to assist Food From the Heart organisation.<br />

	    		<p>First of all, I apologise for the blurry image as I did not have a group photo for this hackathon. The 3 people inside the photo from left to right are me, Benedict, Mr Harvey. This is my second hackathon. BattleHack is an international hackathon organised by PayPal every year in 14 countries all around the globe and still expanding. One thing I remembered clearly during that hackathon was the food. They were no joke when it comes to food. Meal after meal, even desserts and late night snacks are provided. From nutella pizzas to ice cream sandwiches. It was so far the best hackathon I had ever enjoyed.<br />
          <br />
          It was my first time going for public team. Since I had almost no technical skills at that time, it was tough to find a team that needs you, or at least not minding you to take a place in the team. Benedict is my classmate who also wanted to go for a public team. So we teamed up to search for a willing person or team who would accept us. Luckily, Mr Harvey accepted us to be a team with him.<br />
          <br />
          We build a web app again this time but unlike last time, I had to make the front-end from scratch. Since Mr Harvey is a back-end developer, Benedict did not have experience with web front-end development, I am the only one. The name of the web app was FeedMash. It served to pull datas from some news websites as well as feeds from Facebook and Twitter altogether in the same page so that users does not have to navigate between tabs to read the news and the feeds at the same time. Although I had experience, I was not all that good. I had to google a lot during that hackathon to learn and fix my codes, especially on the positioning and display types. These are some of the hard to understand properties in CSS. Honestly, I learned a lot and improved quite significantly on my front-end skills thanks to this event and the opportunity given by Mr Harvey. Another thing I learned is never to forget taking group photos!<br />

          <p>This is an upcoming hackathon which I might be attending. Coincidentally, it is pretty clear I am going to build another web app again most probably. It spans from Friday to Sunday on the weekend after the end of my Mid Semester Test (12 - 14 December 2014). I am honestly excited for this event as this marks my third milestone in coding front-end development. I hoped my skills in creating parallax scrolling websites like this one which I coded from scratch, would be useful.<br />
